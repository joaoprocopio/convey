build for me a products data table with filtering by brand and store.
where you could have 1000 (products) shoes, for the brand Adeedas (brand) in the shanghai store outlet (store).

you don't have to make logic or data fetching.
just give me visual elements in the best possible way, with the most clear and great ux and ui.

each item have:

- id
- name
- supplier information
- brand
- in stock
- batch price
- batch price per unit
- batch id
- quantity available
- quantity produced
- created at

you should have the following functionalities represented by visual elements.

data table:

- can order columns
- hability to do full-text search
- this should be grouped in some way for actions against the table
  - a button to export the table to .xlsx
- hability to select multiple table rows
  - can select all rows
- pagination
- rows per page
- actions for each item
- rows actions
- change the display from list to kanban board

above the table, i want a combobox/command that can filter the brand and store.

- you can select just 1 store, or the whole brand (multiple stores).
- visually these elements are nested, where if you hover, you can see all the stores from a brand
- you can search this element to find a specific store or brand
